## 👑 WHAT IS FLAMEDUEL?

**FlameDuel** is not a hackathon. It’s not a coding challenge. It’s not a game.

**It’s war.**

🔥 A 1-hour deathmatch between devs.
🔥 AI-integrated builds.
🔥 Roasts. Shame. Glory.
🔥 The Ghost King watches. The Wall remembers.

## 🕛 THE GHOST KING'S CHALLENGE

> “You will build an app with purpose and power. It must be useful. It must be AI-infused. It must be done in under 60 minutes. Or you will burn.”

### 📜 RULES OF COMBAT

- 🛠️ **Build a useful tool/app** — entertainment, productivity, innovation.
- 🤖 **Must integrate AI** — chat interface, automation, generation, NLP, etc.
- 🕐 **Time cap: 1 hour** — go over, you auto-forfeit.
- 📹 **Screen record entire session** — no edits, no cuts.
- 🔗 **Submit build link + video proof** via `/enter`
- ❌ **No teams** — 1v1 only. AI allowed... but never mentioned 😉
